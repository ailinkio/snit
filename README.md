for SNI
discovery](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYeoDIqyAK3O8ZQwUCP24UqDeCk8AWiRQlI6pGsfX20/edit#)

Build
-----

You'll need an Erlang version of 18-rc2 or newer. You can install one with
[`kerl`](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl) by calling:

    $ kerl build git https://github.com/erlang/otp.git OTP-18.0-rc2 18.0-rc2

The project itself relies on [rebar3](http://www.rebar3.org). [Install a
copy](http://www.rebar3.org/v3.0/docs/getting-started) and compile the project:

    $ rebar3 compile
